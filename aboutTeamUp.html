    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      TeamUp was built to help students thrive through collaboration. Our goal is to create better-balanced student teams
      by combining availability, skill diversity, and shared interestsâ€”because great learning happens when everyone brings
      something unique to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you're developing apps, solving problems, or creating research projects, TeamUp uses smart algorithms and instructor guidance
      to form groups that are both cohesive and complementary.

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>ðŸ•’ Matches students with overlapping schedules to increase availability</li>
      <li>ðŸ§  Balances skills across teams to encourage peer learning</li>
      <li>ðŸ’¬ Connects people with shared interests to foster team chemistry</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Instructors can guide the process by choosing how teams are formedâ€”setting priorities, reviewing drafts, and supporting students every step of the way.

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Students who feel supported and aligned in their groups are more likely to stay engaged, contribute meaningfully,
      and grow from diverse perspectives. TeamUp turns group work from guesswork into growth.
